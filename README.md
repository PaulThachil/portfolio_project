[Portfolio](https://www.paulthachil.me/)

In this project, I created a responsive and visually engaging portfolio website using HTML and a Bootstrap template. I used GitHub for version control and hosting, which made it easy to collaborate and keep the project up to date. The portfolio features a clean design, intuitive navigation, and is compatible with various devices.
