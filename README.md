## What did I learn?
In this project, I learned valuable skills that deepened my understanding of modern web development. By working with Bootstrap templates, I gained insights into building responsive and visually appealing websites with minimal effort. This experience also enhanced my knowledge of CSS, allowing me to customize and style web pages to match specific design requirements.

I explored HTML and its integration with cookie popups, giving me hands-on experience in creating interactive elements and managing user sessions. Using GitHub Desktop, I learned the basics of version control, including how to manage commits, branches, and collaborative workflows. Additionally, working in sprints introduced me to Agile project management practices, emphasizing iterative development. Overall, these new skills have equipped me with a solid foundation for future web projects and collaborative development environments.
